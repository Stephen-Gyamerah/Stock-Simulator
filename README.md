# Stock-Simulator
This project is a fully self-built stock market simulator developed in C# to demonstrate my understanding of object-oriented programming, modular architecture, and financial logic. It simulates real-world trading behavior, allowing users to manage virtual portfolios, execute trades, and observe dynamic price movements â€” all within a clean, layered codebase and without a user interface.

ðŸ”§ Technologies & Concepts

C# (.NET Core)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Data Structures (List, Dictionary)

Randomised price simulation logic

Layered architecture: Models, Services, Data Layer

Console-based execution (no UI)

ðŸ’¼ Why This Project Matters

Built entirely from scratch to strengthen my software development fundamentals

Demonstrates ability to design and implement scalable, maintainable systems

Highlights problem-solving skills through custom trading logic and simulation

Serves as a foundation for future enhancements like file persistence, analytics, or UI integration

ðŸ“š Key Features

Simulates stock price changes using random walk logic

Enables buying and selling of stocks with cash balance tracking

Tracks user holdings and transaction history

Calculates portfolio value and performance metrics

Clean separation of concerns for maintainability and scalability
